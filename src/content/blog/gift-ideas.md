Adapting this from the list i keep for myself of things I am aiming to buy at some point or another. Doing this in web page form in case i want to update it. 

### Tools

*   M12 FUEL™ 1/2" Hammer Drill + Battery Kit https://www.homedepot.com/p/Milwaukee-M12-FUEL-12-Volt-Lithium-Ion-Brushless-Cordless-1-2-in-Hammer-Drill-Kit-with-1-Compact-2-0Ah-Battery-Pack-and-1-Charger-3404-21/330081981
    *   I dont have a drill (and assume driver would be useful to have), but don't need something super powerful- like the compactness.
        *   there is also a combo with a driver too, but i dont know how much i would use that
*   Dremel Rotary Tool (Corded)
    *   Don't need a super fancy one- used for occasional projects, rocket shenanigans
    

### Clothing

*   Arbor Treeline sweater (https://www.arborcollective.com/products/tree-line-hoodie-evergreen-24?variant=44356063396088)
